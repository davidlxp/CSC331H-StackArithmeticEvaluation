- parenthese `(` and `)` 

## How To Run The Program
To run it locally, please download the files and save them into a folder
- Open terminal and navigate to the project foler
- run command "g++ main.cpp ArithmeticEvaluation.cpp -o main.out" in terminal, and it will generate a "main.out" file in the project folder
- run command "./main.out" in the terminal
