Section: CSC-331H <br/>

The project implement a arithmetic evaluation by using two stacks. It can evaluate mathematical expression that uses: <br/>
1. Integer Number (positive & negative). For example, 1 or -9 <br/>
2. Decimal Number. For example, 4.5 or .9 <br/>
3. Operator including +, -, *, / <br/>
4. parenthese ( and ) <br/>

<h3> How To Run The Program </h3>
To run it locally, please download the files and save them into a folder <br/>
1. Open terminal and navigate to the project foler <br/>
2. run command "g++ main.cpp ArithmeticEvaluation.cpp -o main.out" in terminal, and it will generate a "main.out" file in the project folder <br/>
3. run command "./main.out" in the terminal <br/>
